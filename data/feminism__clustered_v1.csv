40,"Lee, Dong Yul;Gee, Angela;Uhlemann, Max R.",Perception of clients' presenting concern as a function of counsellor-trainees' endorsement of feminism.,"The present study asked the following question: Do novice clinicians' attitudes toward feminism influence their perception of the client's problem? It was predicted that for female clients, the degree to which counsellor-trainees endorse feminist attitudes is related to the attribution of causes, prognosis, and perceived counsellor understanding. After completing a scale assessing their endorsement of feminist attitudes, 150 counsellor-trainees (aged 25â€“55 yrs) viewed 1 of 2 videotaped counselling interviews in which a male counsellor interviewed a male or a female client about his or her presenting concern of depression. The counsellor-trainees were then asked to indicate their perceptions of the client's problem. The results show no significant effect of counsellor-trainees feminist attitudes on their perception of clients' presenting problem of depression.

The scale is reproduced in its entirety. The items are in Likert format, with 5 response alternatives, and deal with acceptance or rejection of central beliefs of feminism rather than attitudes toward avowed feminists. The scale, which was tested with 2 samples of a total of 139 college students, is a short, reliable (r20 = .91) measure that contains a single strong factor explaining 37% of the variance.

205,"Leaper, Campbell;Brown, Christia Spears;Ayres, Melanie M.",Adolescent girls' cognitive appraisals of coping responses to sexual harassment.,"Peer sexual harassment is a stressor for many girls in middle and high school. Prior research indicates that approach strategies (seeking support or confronting) are generally more effective than avoidance strategies in alleviating stress. However, the deployment of effective coping behaviors depends partly on how individuals evaluate different options (i.e., cognitive appraisal). The present study tested sociocultural (ethnicity, parentsâ€™ education), interpersonal (perceived support from peers, mother, and father), developmental (age, perspective taking), and individual (self-esteem, feminist self-identification) factors as predictors of girlsâ€™ cognitive appraisals of coping responses to sexual harassment. The sample comprised 304 girls (M age = 15.5 years, range = 14 to 18 years) from diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds who reported having previously experienced sexual harassment (e.g., unwanted sexual comments or actions). Cognitive appraisals of coping were based on the reported likelihood of confronting, seeking help, or using avoidance in response to sexual harassment. Regression analyses indicated that feminist identity, self-esteem, perspective taking, perceived support, and parentsâ€™ education were variously related to appraisals of different responses.

291,"Rosen, Raye H.;Martindale, Lois J.",Abortion as 'deviance': Traditional female roles vs. the feminist perspective.,"Examined the relationship between changing societal norms concerning women's roles and actual emotional acceptance of them for oneself, specifically as the norms relate to abortion and sexual behavior. It is suggested that elective abortions are viewed as 'deviant' by those who hold traditional views of women, especially as these views relate to women's sexual activity. To test these suggestions, it was hypothesized that the reverse would also be trueâ€”that women who sought early abortions, and thus showed no lag between acceptance of social norms and application of these norms to themselves, would have feminist orientations. 1,598 women with problem pregnancies who either chose or did not choose abortion completed an anonymous self-administered questionnaire containing feminism, perceived competence, and traditional-role attitude scales. Results confirm that those Ss who chose abortion did not show a lag in their emotional acceptance of changing social norms about women's roles; they indicated a nontraditional female role orientation and saw themselves as competent, self-directed, and legitimately sexual persons. Most did not have any great conflict over the decision to have an abortion. There was an indication that the more traditional an S's attitudes were, the more conflict she experienced about the abortion decision, thus supporting the view that abortion is veiwed as 'deviation' by these women.

Most did not have any great conflict over the decision to have an abortion. There was an indication that the more traditional an S's attitudes were, the more conflict she experienced about the abortion decision, thus supporting the view that abortion is veiwed as 'deviation' by these women.

Gender scholars, however, have noticed that these forces are not equal and opposite. The 2016 election represents a critical case for examining how gender-related attitudes and identities push and pull voters. Hillary Clinton was the first female presidential nominee of a major party and a self-proclaimed feminist facing an opponent considered by many to be hostile to women. As such, many observers predicted a substantial increase in the gender gap. However, the gap did not widen much compared to previous races, and nearly half of women chose Trump. Why? We argue that sexism â€“ as commonly measured â€“ mixes attitudes about women in general with those about feminists in particular. When feminism becomes salient, as in 2016, attitudes about this subgroup become more relevant to the vote. Relying on three studies â€“ a 2016 survey on SSI, the 2018 CCES, and the 2016 ANES, we assess the role of anti-feminist attitudes and feminist identity across gender, race, and party. We find that sexism directed against feminists powerfully dampened support for Clinton across genders. However, feminist identity was much less common in the electorate, and had little effect on menâ€™s votes. Thus, although countervailing, these two forces are not equivalent. In 2016, the benefit of appealing to feminists was overwhelmed by the cost of activating voters who intensely dislike the group.

A survey of US undergraduates (N=242) and an online survey of older US adults (N=289) examined the accuracy of this perception. Using self-reported feminism and perceived partners' feminism as predictors of relationship health, results revealed that having a feminist partner was linked to healthier relationships for women. Additionally, men with feminist partners reported greater relationship stability and sexual satisfaction in the online survey. Finally, there was no support for negative feminist stereotypes (i.e., that feminists are single, lesbians, or unattractive). In concert, the findings reveal that beliefs regarding the incompatibility of feminism and romance are inaccurate.

Three online survey studies, which included 387, 288, and 116 adult U.S. women, demonstrate that perception of warmth identification with feminism was lower if women regard feminists as less warm than they see themselves. For perceptions of competence, the direction of this discrepancy was irrelevant: The more women see feminists as differently competent (i.e., higher or lower), the less they identify with feminists. Moreover, perceived discrepancy predicted identification with feminism even after controlling for womenâ€™s agreement with feminist values. Both endorsement of feminist values and perceived discrepancy are important in predicting identification with feminism and therefore practical interventions to maximize identification should target both of these components.

The results of Study 1 (n = 135) revealed that Spanish women and men with weaker feminist identification showed a higher proclivity to participate in collective action for gender equality after being exposed to subversive humor against sexism (vs. neutral humor). Study 2 (n = 134 Spanish women and men) replicated these results and expanded them to behavioral intentions to participate in this type of collective action. Our findings show the potential implications of using this type of humor for collective action for gender equality. Overall, subversive humor against sexism may function as a supportive tool to combat sexist attitudes, discrimination against women, and gender inequality by raising awareness in people with lower feminist identity to get them more involved in collective action. This approach would facilitate recruiting activists, getting more media coverage, and building a collective identity supporting mobilization against sexism.

The present set of studies tests the concept of threat, grounded in G. A. Kellyâ€™s personal construct theory of personality, as a potential factor in feminist nonidentification. Study 1 introduces the theoretically grounded Feminist Threat Index and evaluates its psychometric properties with data from 91 undergraduate students. In this study, feminist threat scores yielded acceptable evidence of convergent and discriminant validity and of testâ€“retest reliability. Study 2 evaluates a theoretically grounded intervention designed to reduce level of feminist threat and increase degree of feminist identification by enabling students to interact with a diverse panel of feminists. In this study, a mixed betweenâ€“within subjects design was employed to compare pre- and postintervention change in continuous threat and feminist identification scores across intervention (n = 52) and comparison (n = 63) groups. As expected, the intervention reduced level of threat and increased degree of feminist identification significantly in the intervention group, whereas these scores remained unchanged in the comparison group.

600,"DeBlaere, Cirleen;Bertsch, Kristin N.",Perceived sexist events and psychological distress of sexual minority women of color: The moderating role of womanism.,"Scholars have argued that much of the sexism literature has not acknowledged diversity among women, and they have called for more attention to the intersectionality of the multiple marginalized identities of sexual minority women of color (WOC) in particular. With a sample of 182 sexual minority WOC, we examined (a) the links between perceived lifetime and recent sexist events and psychological distress and (b) the potential moderating role in these relations of womanism (a perspective of feminism that recognizes the roles of both gender and race/ethnicity in the lives of WOC). Findings from our Internet survey indicated that lifetime and recent sexism were related significantly and positively to psychological distress. Womanism was also associated positively with both forms of sexism and psychological distress. In partial support of study hypotheses, womanism moderated the relationship between perceived lifetime sexist events, but not recent sexist events, and psychological distress. More specifically, the link between lifetime sexist events and psychological distress was significant and positive for sexual minority WOC with lower levels of womanism and not significant for those with higher levels of womanism. With regard to practice implications, assessing and exploring sexist events, placing these experiences in a larger sociocultural context of oppression, connecting with the legacy of social activism of marginalized groups, and encouraging supportive networks may diminish distress.

Methods: An unobtrusive questioning technique known as the list experiment is used to measure Americansâ€™ support for immigration restrictionism. The list experiment can easily be embedded in a standard telephone survey and has been used by previous investigators to study racial attitudes. Results: Restrictionist sentiments are found to be more widespread among the U.S. populace than previous studies have estimated, especially among college graduates and political liberals. Conclusion: My findings have implications for immigration scholars and social scientists who study other sensitive attitudes and behaviors. The most commonly employed strategies to reduce socially desirable responding may not be enough.

Thus, it is essential to publicly address issues related to gender inequality as a first step towards advancing change in this domain. However, those who address gender inequality may encounter personal costs. In the current research, we examined reactions to women who â€œput gender on the table.â€ In Study 1 (N = 202), men who were exposed to a woman who raised the issue of gender inequality (vs. age inequality or a neutral topic), had more negative attitudes towards both her and gender equality. In Study 2, (N = 233), women high on feminist identification were more positive toward a woman who discussed gender inequality (vs. other topics), whereas women low on feminist identification were more negative toward both her and the issue.

Data were gathered from student populations (Study 1 n = 199, Study 2 n = 230) and community samples obtained through MTurk (Study 1 n = 204, Study 2 n = 260). Study 1 identified, and Study 2 replicated, four components underlying the concept of feminism (positive personal characteristics, negative stereotypes of feminists, equality/fairness ideals, and stereotypes of womanhood). Further, cluster analysis identified two groups of participants across both studies: (1) one that associates feminism with equality/fairness ideals while being relatively neutral towards the other factors, and (2) one that accentuates the positive aspects of feminism (equality/fairness ideals and positive personal characteristics) while downplaying the negative aspects of feminism (negative stereotypes of feminists). Cluster membership was related to self-identification as a feminist, with the group that accentuates the positive while downplaying the negative being more likely to self-identify as feminist.

The current study sought to further clarify these relationships by examining three levels of vegetarianism, motivation for vegetarianism, and feminist identity (using an updated measure). Method: Participants were 90 female undergraduate students and community members (mean age=24.34 years). Dietary restraint was measured using the TFEQ; feminism was assessed using the LFAIS. Results: Weight-motivated semi-vegetarians reported higher levels of dietary restraint than those not motivated by weight. This effect did not appear among full-vegetarians. Lowest levels of dietary restraint were found among full-vegetarians with no difference between non- and semi-vegetarians. Contrary to previous research, feminist identity did not moderate the relationship between dietary restraint and vegetarianism. Discussion: Limitations resulting from a scale with a narrow definition of feminism and the use of multiple sources of recruitment are discussed. Directions for future research are highlighted.

876,"Precopio, Renee F.;Ramsey, Laura R.",Dude looks like a feminist!: Moral concerns and feminism among men.,"Even though male participation in feminism is essential to its success, it is possible that men are reluctant to get involved in the movement because of its primary association with women (Holmgren & Hearn, 2009). This research investigated whether certain moral concerns contribute to men endorsing feminism. According to the moral foundations theory (MFT), there are five moral concerns: harm (i.e., the concern for someoneâ€™s physical and emotional well-being), fairness (i.e., the concern for equality and justice), ingroup (i.e., the concern for loyalty to group membership), authority (i.e., the concern for tradition and the social hierarchy), and purity (i.e., the concern for physical and spiritual cleanliness; Graham et al., 2011). Graham, Haidt, and Nosek (2009) found that harm and fairness correlate to liberalism; therefore we predicted that menâ€™s feminism would be associated with an increased emphasis on those moral concerns and a decreased emphasis on ingroup, authority, and purity. Using an online survey methodology, participants were assessed on various aspects of feminism and morality. The results generally supported our predictions that higher support for conservative moral concerns correlates to less endorsement of feminism, whereas higher support for liberal moral concerns correlates to more endorsement of feminism, even when controlling for political ideology. This research contributes to our understanding of male resistance to and support of the feminist movement.

881,"Marshall, Susan E.;Read, Jen'nan Ghazal",Identity politics among Arab-American Women.,"Objective: Identity politics has dominated contemporary analyses of protest movements. Although multiple identities are commonplace, progress in delineating their empirical relationship has been slow. This article examines the relationships among ethnic and religious identities and feminist orientations among Arab-American women, a group that bridges multiple cultural identities. The primary research question is whether ethnic and religious identities undermine feminism in this population or whether multiple identities are mutually supportive. Methods: Using data from a national mail survey of Arab-American women, regression analyses examine the separate effects of various dimensions of ethnic and religious identity on women's feminist orientations. Results: Arab political identity is positively associated with feminism while religious and feminist identities are inversely related. The effects of ethnic cultural identity and Muslim affiliation are negligible. Conclusions: This study finds a complex pattern of relationships among multiple identities and underscores the underlying political dynamic linking group identities.

Percentage of women clients was not significantly correlated with attitudes toward feminism, liberal gender role attitudes, or feminist therapeutic behaviors.

895,"Shomer, Robert W.;Centers, Richard",Differences in attitudinal responses under conditions of implicitly manipulated group salience.,"Hypothesized that: (a) salience of group membership might be aroused implicitly by cues provided in the objective situation without the explicit reminders of group membership used in previous research; and (b) by varying number of persons of each sex, in an aggregate responding to a questionnaire which included material relevant to the sex group norms, the salience of the norms of the respective groups would be aroused, and these norms would influence responses to the relevant material. 214 undergraduates responded anonymously to a questionnaire dealing with attitudes toward feminism and child rearing, under 3 conditions of group composition, with either a male or female E. Results show that males' responses on feminist items varied significantly over the conditions of group composition, but females' did not. Responses to the child-rearing items did not vary for either sex over conditions of group composition. It is concluded that results for male Ss are the result of the resolution of conflicting norms chauvinism and chivalry. The relevance of this experiment to methodological procedures is indicated, stressing that in the administration of group questionnaires, even though anonymous, neither the characteristics of the individuals composing the aggregate nor those of the administrator could be ignored.

There were also significant direct and indirect partner effects, including the association between mothers’ feminist attitudes and daughters’ voice, and between daughters’ voice and mothers’ psychological well-being. These results highlight the psychological benefits of mothers and daughters having stronger feminist attitudes and being able to assert their voice in their close relationships.

Feminist media scholars have asserted that makeup videos are based on postfeminist culture. Postfeminism defines femininity as a bodily property and focuses on enhancing appearance through consumption. To quantitatively confirm the results of feminist media studies, the current study theorized a psychological mechanism through which viewing frequency of and interest in makeup tutorials influence postfeminist beliefs in young women, using three traditional media effects theories (cultivation theory, social cognitive theory, and social comparison theory). A two-wave longitudinal survey was conducted in South Korea, which is considered one of the big five cosmetics markets worldwide. A path analysis showed that both frequency and interest at Wave 1 (W1) indirectly influenced postfeminist beliefs at W2 through social comparison (social comparison theory) at W1. Interest at W1 also had an indirect effect on postfeminist beliefs at W2 through outcome expectations (social cognitive theory) at W1. Societal prevalence (cultivation theory) was positively associated with frequency of viewing, but did not serve as a mediator.

This study was conducted to determine the extent to which undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory gerontology course (n = 156) were knowledgeable about age-related changes in sexual expression; the role of political views on attitudes regarding aging and sexuality; relationships among prior sexuality education, knowledge, and attitudes regarding aging and sexuality; and differences in knowledge and attitudes between those with and without an intended career in aging. Results: Students espousing liberal political views were more likely to support continued sexual behaviors among older adults regardless of marital status or residential location. They held attitudes that sexual expression is a personal decision and not one to be made by family or facility staff. Prior sex education was not associated with attitudes toward or knowledge about sexual behavior in adulthood, indicating a deficiency in prior education on adult sexuality.

This study was conducted to determine the extent to which undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory gerontology course (n = 156) were knowledgeable about age-related changes in sexual expression; the role of political views on attitudes regarding aging and sexuality; relationships among prior sexuality education, knowledge, and attitudes regarding aging and sexuality; and differences in knowledge and attitudes between those with and without an intended career in aging. Results: Students espousing liberal political views were more likely to support continued sexual behaviors among older adults regardless of marital status or residential location. They held attitudes that sexual expression is a personal decision and not one to be made by family or facility staff. Prior sex education was not associated with attitudes toward or knowledge about sexual behavior in adulthood, indicating a deficiency in prior education on adult sexuality. Those who were considering a career in aging were more knowledgeable about age-related changes in sexuality.

This study also analyzed observations of gender harassment and sexual harassment as evidence of experience with gender bias. Data were obtained from the Florida Gender Bias Study (Florida Supreme Court Task Force, 1990) in which 1,655 attorneys and 366 judges were surveyed.

The results showed gender's pervasive influence on gender-bias observations, feminist consciousness, and the relationship between bias and consciousness. While women's observations of (more) gender bias were associated with heightened feminist consciousness, this pattern was much less true for men, both judges and attorneys.

A total of 2,334 Chinese adult women completed the scale for this study. In study 1 (n = 875), exploratory analysis indicated six factors, Passive Acceptance, Revelation, Embeddedness/Emanation, Active Commitment, and Synthesis, the latter of which was divided into two subscales (Femininity Synthesis and Autonomous Synthesis). In study 2 (n = 810), confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with a different sample to examine the construct validity of the model obtained in study 1. In study 3 (n = 649), the convergent validity of the FIC was examined via their relationship with willingness to engage in feminist behaviors and attitude toward trans-people. The results indicated that a new measurement with solid conceptual and psychometrically solid properties needs to be developed to assess Chinese womenâ€™s feminist identity.

In particular, the study examined the relation between antecedents and outcomes of their experiences as well as influences of attribution styles, response styles and different types of violence on their experiences. Using the Myanmar version of the Revised Conflict Tactic Scale, survey data from a representative sample of 286 women in Myanmar were conducted. Results indicated that 27% of women experienced physical assault and 69% of women experienced psychological aggression in a 1-year period. The factors associated with increased risks of violence included witnessing parental violence, husbands' unemployment, husbands' frequent alcohol use, and women's feminism attitudes.

This study presents a measure of feminist identity that accounts for beliefs and behaviors of self-identified feminists and nonfeminists, and for a third group, egalitarians, who endorse liberal feminist beliefs but reject the feminist label. In a sample of 272 college-educated women, a MANOVA showed egalitarians had levels of feminist consciousness between nonfeminists and feminists. Egalitarians did not differ from nonfeminists on favorable conditions for feminist identity or on feminist activism, but both groups scored lower on these measures than feminists. In a hierarchical multiple regression, feminist identity was a significant predictor of feminist activism, above and beyond favorable conditions and barriers. The importance of self-labeling for invisible and stigmatized social identities is discussed.

Latent Class Analysis revealed that the FSIS successfully distinguishes between different levels of feminist identity.

In two studies we primed women and men with (counter) stereotypical roles and measured implicit activation of reactance versus acceptance goals, task persistence, and support for system justification beliefs and collective action. Although we found no direct evidence of reactance activation, men activated acceptance when primed with gender stereotypes, whereas women did not. Further, traditional women legitimize the system after counter-stereotypical exposure, whereas progressive women (feminist identifiers) persist more in solving a task stereotypically favoring men under these conditions (Study 1). Finally, nonsexist women show higher support for collective action after stereotypical exposure when threat to their identity is blatant (Study 2). We argue that reactions to identity threats depend on the content of that identity so that the specific form reactance takes may depend on the group norms being threatened.
