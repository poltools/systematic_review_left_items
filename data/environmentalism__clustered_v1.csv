However, there has been only a small amount of literature concerning the human dimensions of managing marine protected areas. Several researchers and managers have suggested a need to learn more about stakeholders' attitudes and concerns regarding marine protected areas (Agardy, 2004; Bellwood, Hughes, Folke, & Nystrom, 2004; Hinrichsen, 1997). This paper describes an investigation that sought to identify the thoughts and feelings recreational visitors ascribe to two different marine protected areas: the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Specifically, we used a modified version of Stern, Kalof, Dietz, and Guagnano's (1995) Value-Belief-Norm Theory of Environmentalism to guide our investigation. Via identical survey instruments distributed in Queensland, Australia during 2008 and in the United States' Florida Keys in 2010, we identified respondents' environmental worldview, awareness of consequences of human impacts, ascription of responsibility, personal norms toward reducing impacts, and intention to behave in a pro-environmental manner. We then compared the values, beliefs, norms, and behavioral intentions of each group with one another in order to describe the similarities and differences between the American and Australian respondents. This is one of the first pieces of research to document the antecedents to pro-environmental behavior in marine protected areas. It is also unique in that it compares stakeholder perceptions of anthropogenic impacts at two marine parks on opposite sides of the globe. Furthermore, these data and analyses, combined with existing literature, highlight how the Value-Belief-Norm theory can be used as a framework for managers to understand stakeholders' thoughts about their own pro-environmental behavior.

However, there has been only a small amount of literature concerning the human dimensions of managing marine protected areas. Several researchers and managers have suggested a need to learn more about stakeholders' attitudes and concerns regarding marine protected areas (Agardy, 2004; Bellwood, Hughes, Folke, & Nystrom, 2004; Hinrichsen, 1997). This paper describes an investigation that sought to identify the thoughts and feelings recreational visitors ascribe to two different marine protected areas: the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Specifically, we used a modified version of Stern, Kalof, Dietz, and Guagnano's (1995) Value-Belief-Norm Theory of Environmentalism to guide our investigation. Via identical survey instruments distributed in Queensland, Australia during 2008 and in the United States' Florida Keys in 2010, we identified respondents' environmental worldview, awareness of consequences of human impacts, ascription of responsibility, personal norms toward reducing impacts, and intention to behave in a pro-environmental manner. We then compared the values, beliefs, norms, and behavioral intentions of each group with one another in order to describe the similarities and differences between the American and Australian respondents. This is one of the first pieces of research to document the antecedents to pro-environmental behavior in marine protected areas. It is also unique in that it compares stakeholder perceptions of anthropogenic impacts at two marine parks on opposite sides of the globe. Furthermore, these data and analyses, combined with existing literature, highlight how the Value-Belief-Norm theory can be used as a framework for managers to understand stakeholders' thoughts about their own pro-environmental behavior. We discuss how managers might use this knowledge as part of environmental information and education programs to increase the likelihood that visitors will adopt pro-environmental behaviors that help conserve marine protected areas.",2013,,environmentalism,the balance of nature is strong enough to cope with the impacts of modern industrial nations,"['balance', 'nature', 'strong', 'enough', 'cope', 'impact', 'modern', 'industrial', 'nation']","['balance', 'nature', 'strong', 'impact', 'modern', 'industrial', 'nation']","['nation', 'strong', 'modern', 'nature', 'industrial', 'impact', 'balance']",nation strong modern nature industrial impact balance,"[-0.05175533  1.22527695  0.05801209 ...  1.27961707  0.71168858

The number of students involved in the whole research is 952. The results of the work show that a certain level of worry exists among the students regarding environmental problems, which is apparent in the need to increase environmental education and research. Some differences in environmental attitudes were also found between first year students and final year students and male and female students.

To assess the experience, the students completed a questionnaire about different aspects of the proposal at the end of the semester, along with a validated questionnaire about sustainability awareness.

The aim of this work is to present a qualitative analysis of the movie proposals prepared by preservice teachers in the context of an educational experience around the ecofeminist movement. The responses to a final questionnaire about sustainability awareness are also analysed. Originality: The description and analysis of an educational proposal based on the ecofeminist movement to foster creativity is of great novelty. Methods. The participants were 47 alumni of the Grades of Early Childhood Education and Primary Education at a Spanish university. After a lecture about ecofeminism and reading a series of fragments of the young literature novel Yabari by Lola Robles (2017), preservice teachers had to prepare the proposal for an ecofeminist movie, with a synopsis, plot, characters description, cast, and the script for a key scene. To assess the experience, the students completed a questionnaire about different aspects of the proposal at the end of the semester, along with a validated questionnaire about sustainability awareness. Results and conclusion. The analysis of the ecofeminist movies prepared and the responses to the questionnaires shows how the students were able to assimilate the ecofeminist them; and incorporate them in their reflection about sustainability. This is also manifested in the results of the Attitudes toward Sustainable Development scale, which indicate a high level of sustainability attitudes in these preservice teachers, with no differences between genders. The creativity of these preservice teachers is evident in the variety of approaches to the topic in the different movies proposed. We can conclude that the ecofeminist topic is relevant in the dassroom because it contributes to enhancing the ethical debate and driving the teaching-learning process in an interdisciplinary manner, perfectly aligned with the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.",2021,,environmentalism,teachers in college should promote critical thinking rather than lecturing,"['teacher', 'college', 'promote', 'critical', 'thinking', 'rather', 'lecture']","['teacher', 'college', 'critical', 'thinking']","['teacher', 'college', 'critical', 'thinking']",teacher college critical thinking,"[ 2.48025155  0.17011014 -1.66130781 ... -1.16648126 -1.4489814

199,"Chonody, Jill M.;Sultzman, Vickey;Hippie, Jennifer",Are social work students concerned about the environment?: The role of personal beliefs.,"The profession of social work is committed to social justice issues, and part of this mission includes the environment. Specifically, the Council on Social Work Education supports equality in environmental justice, ecological unity among species, and using ecological resources in a responsible way. However, a dearth exists in the literature with regard to social work students’ concern about the environment and what predicts their support. This study sought to redress this gap. Social work students (N = 724) from programs throughout the country were surveyed about their environmental beliefs and behaviors. An ordinary least squares regression indicated that holding more liberal political beliefs, identifying as a nonreligious individual, placing greater personal importance on environmental issues, participating in environmentally conscious behaviors, espousing greater confidence in scientists’ understanding of climate change, and being older were associated with greater environmental concern, and these variables explained 51.5% of the variance. Greater inclusion of environmental justice and avenues for advocacy that create social change should be part of the social work curricula if practitioners who are ready for this area of practice across the micro–macro continuum are to be developed.

Across three studies, we show PMI to be distinct from other efficacy-based constructs and a powerful predictor of pro-environmental and socially-motivated behavior. Specifically, consumers are motivated to act when they believe their behavior influences other marketplace actors. We develop a ten-item scale for PMI and display its predictive and incremental validity in explaining environmental behavior before showing its power to translate environmental concern into corresponding behavior. We then find that PMI predicts social environmentalism and environmental citizenship behaviors, and that these effects are attenuated by consumer skepticism of marketing. While complementing existing efficacy-related beliefs with its explicit marketplace focus, PMI provides an important tool for marketers operating in environmental and prosocial niches by allowing them to understand and target the consumers most likely to adopt their products or attempt to recruit others in environmentally-motivated efforts.

275,"Milfont, Taciano L.;Duckitt, John",The structure of environmental attitudes: A first- and second-order confirmatory factor analysis.,"This paper addressed two questions: (1) Do environmental attitudes form a two-factor second-order structure as proposed by (Pers. Individ. Diff. 34 (2003) 783) and others? If so, (2) do these two factors differentially predict self-reported ecological behaviour and economic liberalism? A questionnaire with 99 items from established measures of environmental attitudes was administered to 455 undergraduate students and two procedures were used to test the higher-order factor structure of these attitudes. First, all the items were forced into two-factor and one-factor solutions using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and the fit of these solutions then tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Second, EFA was used to extract first-order factors, which were themselves factor analysed to extract second-order factors. CFA indicated that a correlated two-factor solution, consisting of a Preservation factor and an Utilization factor, provided the best fit to the data. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by showing that self-reported ecological behaviour was predicted by the Preservation factor, and not by Utilization, while attitudes toward economic liberalism were predicted by Utilization, and not by Preservation.

This investigation provides further insight on the psychological processes driving self-reported behavioral engagement among visitors to Channel Islands National Park in the United States. We used latent variable structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized structure stipulated by the value-belief-norm (VBN) theory of environmentalism. Biospheric-altruistic values geared toward non-human species and concern for other people positively predicted environmental worldview and pro-environmental behavior, whereas egoistic values negatively influenced moral norm activation. Consistent with previous research, findings also showed that belief structures and personal moral norms gave rise to conservation behaviors reported by visitors to the park.

In this research, we approach this question by referring to the role of social axioms, a set of generalized beliefs that embody people's assumptions and expectations about how the social world functions. There are five social axioms specifically: social cynicism, reward for application, social complexity, fate control, and religiosity. We contend that when facing environmental issues, people will resort to their social axioms as these axioms help them understand those issues and evaluate their capability to tackle them through personal and/or collective efforts. As expected, in three studies, we found that the five axioms were associated with environmental attitude and efficacy beliefs: reward for application and social complexity were associated with a more pro-environmental orientation, whereas social cynicism, fate control, and religiosity were related to a less pro-environmental orientation. In Study 3, we additionally demonstrated the unique contribution of social axioms in explaining environmentalism with values and big five personality traits controlled for. These findings support the use of the concept of social axioms as a novel framework for understanding individual differences in environmentalism.

The present research aimed at reviewing the existing literature and constructing the Climate Self-Protection Scale (CSPS) to make climate-relevant defensive self-protection measurable.

Study 2 (N = 453 Germans) used confirmatory factor analysis to verify the five-factorial structure of the CSPS. Self-protective strategies were positively related with each other (except for avoidance and denial of guilt) and fit into a framework of interpretive (denial of global and personal outcome severity) and implicatory denial (rationalization, avoidance, denial of guilt).

In the present research, we propose that there are differences in the consideration of future consequences, as well as the perception of climate change in time, between conservatives and liberals which, in part, contribute to this gap. Across three studies (total N = 654) in the Netherlands and the UK, we demonstrate that, compared to liberals, conservatives tend to consider future consequences of their behaviour less and perceive the effects of climate change as further away in the future. Furthermore, we find that temporal distance to climate change, and, to a lesser extent, consideration of future consequences, can partially account for higher levels of scepticism about climate change on the conservative side of the ideological spectrum. Besides contributing to a better understanding of this ideology bias, these results have implications for climate change communication.

Positive effects of Spirituality on environmental attitudes were partly mediated though trait compassion and moral foundations of harm and fairness. Negative effects of Fundamentalism were partly explained through differences in Right-Wing Authoritarianism. Together, opposing influences of Spirituality and Fundamentalism were better predictors of environmental concerns than general religiosity, and held when controlling for political attitudes. We conclude that religious environmentalism is best predicted through the combined effects of Spirituality and Fundamentalism as a function of underlying social-moral attitudes.

In this paper, we assess two well-established scales, the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) and the Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS), on how well they measure the underlying construct of pro-environmental orientation. The items of these scales offer strong face validity, but mainly from a politically left tradition, which may reduce validity among political conservatives.

Additionally, we present a novel measure of environmental orientation using diverse moral language to avoid ideological framing: the Moral Environmentalism Scale (MES). The MES is validated here using MTurk workers (n = 448), and a more representative sample from Survey Sampling International (n = 499). In these validation studies, the MES moderated the relationship between party identification and behavior while CNS and NEP did not. Item-level analyses of the MES scale using two measurement periods revealed robust item characteristics. Seen together, all three scales offer a more complete picture of pro-environmental orientation measurement validity and inform scale selection for future research.

Design: Descriptive cross-sectional convenience sample; self-administered online surveys. Setting: College students at a Midwest university. Participants: Currently enrolled students aged 18â€“30 taking courses on campus as of March 2020. Main Outcome Measures: Plant-based alternative consumption; demographics; vegetarian status; environmental attitudes; influences on food choices; and trusted sources of food information. Analysis: Bivariate comparisons for consumption of plant-based alternatives; logistic regression analysis. Results: Fifty-five percent had tried a plant-based meat alternative. Top reasons were enjoying new foods and curiosity about the products. Out-of-state residency, vegetarian status, and 10 of 11 environmental attitude statements were significantly associated with plant-based alternative consumption (P < 0.05). About 30% of consumers indicated they wanted to eat less meat and that plant alternatives were better for the environment. Nonconsumers had less favorable views of meatless meals.

This study employed two online surveys of U.S. adults (total of 1,330 respondents) to examine the contribution of demographic, psychographic, and other variables for describing consumers with environment-friendly attitudes. The results confirmed the limited value of demographics (e.g., age was not related to green attitudes). New variables tested included impulsiveness behavior, privacy concerns, religiosity, spirituality, risk and time preferences, handedness, and political orientation. Although most green studies have not included social desirability bias controls, this measure appeared to be important. Other variables that were positively linked to green attitudes include hedonic consumption, privacy concerns, spirituality measures, risk preferences, and liberal political preferences. These results offer new insights for building segments of green consumers, for developing messages for these consumers, and for efficiently communicating with consumers who have environment-friendly attitudes.

Over a hundred Canadian youth completed a questionnaire that measured generative concerns. Environmentalism was assessed by questionnaires on involvement, identity, and attitudes, as well as through narratives about personal experiences with the environment. Narratives were coded for meaning, vividness, and impact of environmentalism. Stronger generative concern in emerging adulthood positively predicted environmentalism after controlling for liberal political orientation and benevolence values. Qualitative analyses of the environmental narrative of participants high in generative concerns revealed three themes that highlight the developmental process that ties generative concerns to environmentalism: (1) wanting to feel more empowered to help the environment, (2) the role of having children as a focus for crystallizing environmentalism, and (3) the passing on of specific family traditions from earlier generations. Environmentalism thus may be one important domain of expression for generative care in youth.

578,"PreisendÃ¶rfer, Peter;Herold, Lucie;Kurz, Karin",Road traffic and aircraft noise as drivers of environmental protest?,"This article investigates whether and to what extent unfavorable local environmental conditions furnish an important motivator for environmental protest. We do so using individual-level data on objective and subjectively perceived residential road traffic and aircraft noise pollution, pertaining to the cities of Mainz (Germany) and Zurich (Switzerland). By referring to fine-grained noise data, we are able to test the predictive power of grievances and self-interest in explaining protest participation more stringently than has been the case in most previous studies. Theoretically, our study is inspired by Klandermansâ€™ socio-psychological framework of political protest, the pressure-response approach, the self-interest perspective, and the collective-interest model. Our empirical findings only partially confirm the grievances assumption that unfavorable local environmental conditions in the form of residential road traffic and aircraft noise stimulate environmental protest. Noise caused by airplanes seems to be more â€œprotest-inducingâ€ than that produced by road traffic. It is not so much the objectively measurable noise level as its subjective perception and evaluation that are deciding factors. However, in line with Klandermansâ€™ protest framework and other theories of political protest, there are more influential drivers of environmental protest, such as environmental concerns and a left-wing political ideology. Thus, the effects of residential road traffic and aircraft noise turn out to be relatively moderate. Ultimately, this means that our tailored measures of grievances corroborate a relatively well-established finding of protest research.

We do so using individual-level data on objective and subjectively perceived residential road traffic and aircraft noise pollution, pertaining to the cities of Mainz (Germany) and Zurich (Switzerland). By referring to fine-grained noise data, we are able to test the predictive power of grievances and self-interest in explaining protest participation more stringently than has been the case in most previous studies. Theoretically, our study is inspired by Klandermansâ€™ socio-psychological framework of political protest, the pressure-response approach, the self-interest perspective, and the collective-interest model. Our empirical findings only partially confirm the grievances assumption that unfavorable local environmental conditions in the form of residential road traffic and aircraft noise stimulate environmental protest. Noise caused by airplanes seems to be more â€œprotest-inducingâ€ than that produced by road traffic.

In a survey of 4,600 Australians, environmentalists were found to be consumer-conscious, anti-authoritarian, anti-Australia, less interested in personal success, antifashion, counterculturally oriented, and hedonistic. All except the 1st characteristic were, however, very weak tendencies. In addition, environmentalists were equally likely to go either way on social conservatism, economic conservatism, sociability, and misanthropy.

Although it is now beyond any doubt that contact can reduce prejudice, in this article we provide evidence that its benefits can extend beyond intergroup relationsâ€”a process referred to as cognitive liberalization (Hodson, Crisp, Meleady, & Earle, 2018). We focus specifically on the impact of intergroup contact on environmentally relevant attitudes and behavior. Recent studies suggest that support for an inequality-based ideology (social dominance orientation [SDO]) can predict both intergroup attitudes and broader environmental conduct. Individuals higher in SDO are more willing to exploit the environment in unsustainable ways because doing so aids the production and maintenance of hierarchical social structures. In 4 studies conducted with British adults, we show that by promoting less hierarchical and more egalitarian viewpoints (reduced SDO), intergroup contact encourages more environmentally responsible attitudes and behavior. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal data support this model. Effects are more strongly explained by reductions in an antiegalitarian motive than a dominance motive. We discuss how these findings help define an expanded vision for intergroup contact theory that moves beyond traditional conflict-related outcomes.

646,"Arnocky, Steven;Desrochers, Jessica;Locke, Ashley",Entitlement predicts lower proenvironmental attitudes and behavior in young adults.,"Environmental advocates commonly describe ecological problems as being caused, at least in part, by the psychological construct of human entitlement. Nevertheless, the concept of trait entitlement, as an individual difference variable, has not yet been considered in relation to proenvironmental attitudes and behavior. This research examined whether entitlement among young adults correlates with environmental attitudes and actions. Results showed that individuals who were high in entitlement scored lower in attitudes in favor of protecting the environment, self-reported environmental behavior, and were less likely to engage in observable environmental action by way of donating money earned from the study to an environmental cause. Conversely, those high in entitlement were more in favor of human utilization of the environment and supported geoengineering efforts. Mediation analysis showed that environmental attitude mediated the links between entitlement and both donating and conservation behavior. Together, these results highlight the role of trait entitlement as a barrier to environmentalism.

It segments consumers according to two apparently contradictory dimensions of smart environmental objects: environment (i.e. environmental concern and environmental beliefs) and technology (i.e. materialistic values and technological beliefs). Design/methodology/approach: A cluster analysis was conducted among 658 French consumers based on their environmental concern, environmental beliefs, materialistic values, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. A regression analysis identifies the variables with the greatest influence on purchase intentions. Findings: Four segments result from the analysis: unconcerned, retro eco-friendly, non-materialistic converted and converted. The converted consumer segment had the highest purchase intentions and exhibited high levels of both environmental beliefs and perceived usefulness compared with the other segments. Both environmental and technological beliefs and environmental concern influence purchase intentions more broadly. Research limitations/implications: A combined consideration of both environmental and technological beliefs is necessary to influence purchase intentions towards smart environmental objects. This study challenges some previous research that assumes a clear opposition between materialism and environmentalism. Practical implications: This study proposes tailored managerial recommendations for each of the four consumer segments in the context of smart environmental objects.

It was predicted that Ss with Democratic party preferences and liberal political ideologies would exhibit higher rates of pro-environmental attitudes and actions than Ss with Republican preferences and conservative ideologies. Among those indicating a traditional party preference, the Democratic party was heavily favored over the Republican party--101 (68.2%) vs 47 (31.8%). 66 Ss (28.8%) designated themselves as liberals, 112 (48.9%) as moderates, and 51 (22.3%) as conservatives. 56.2% indicated great interest in environmental issues, and 50% indicated that they had taken at least one positive environmental action. Correlational analyses supported the hypotheses, and indicated that Democratic and liberal Ss were more likely to locate the sources of environmental problems in the nature of contemporary social structure than Republican and conservative Ss who were more likely to view environmental degradation as a 'people problem.'

765,"Levi, Daniel J.;Holder, Elaine E.",Nuclear power: The dynamics of acceptability.,"175 psychology and 35 landscape architecture students completed a questionnaire concerning the construction of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant to test the hypotheses that antinuclear attitudes are a function of broader environmental concern and that antinuclear attitudes and behaviors are irrational and result from phobic thinking. The questionnaire assessed attitudes toward nuclear war, anxiety levels, environmental concern, and energy issues and nuclear power (NP). Results show that acceptance of NP plants correlated negatively with environmentalism and positively with belief in experts' evaluations of the safety of NP plants. Although environmentalism correlated with NP attitudes, these appeared to be separate issues. Environmentalism also correlated with other energy issues, such as energy conservation and burning coal. There was no significant relationship between NP attitudes and self-reported measures of anxiety about aging, dependency, and death. However, NP protesters had lower anxiety scores with regard to dependency issues. Findings are counter to the notion that NP opponents engage in irrational thinking and suffer from higher levels of anxiety.

Building upon previous work examining predictors of responses to such tactics and willingness to label them as â€œtorture,â€ this research tested whether the â€œtortureâ€ label itself can influence attitudes. Across five experiments using two different populations, both politically liberal and conservative participants showed more negative attitudes toward â€œtortureâ€ than â€œenhanced interrogation,â€ even given identical descriptions of the tactics. This greater negativity in response to â€œtortureâ€ extended to actual behavior (signing a petition) and was driven by cognitive appraisals of severity as well as feelings of personal distress and other-directed empathic concern. Furthermore, there was a small but significant effect for such effects to be stronger among conservatives than liberals. These findings have implications for the underpinnings of attitudes toward torture, potential ways to shift such attitudes, and the psychological consequences of labels.

850,"Thapa, Brijesh",The mediation effect of outdoor recreation participation on environmental attitude-behavior correspondence.,"Outdoor recreation participation has increased over the past decades and is projected for further growth. Given the increase, it is important to assess recreationists' environmental values, activity style, general, and site-specific attitudes and behaviors to promote environmental stewardship, and to develop effective strategies in natural resource management and public policy. This study explored recreationists' environmental attitude-behavior relationship and the impact of outdoor recreation activity orientation (as a mediator variable) on attitude-behavior correspondence. Overall, attitudes exhibited stronger direct relationships with behaviors, when compared to the effect of participation on behaviors. The influence of activity participation on attitude-behavior correspondence was not significantly demonstrative. The association between participation in outdoor recreation and environmentalism is complex, and there is a need for additional research to better understand the relationship.

897,"Johnson, Branden B.",Bases of support differ for deer reduction versus behavior change options to manage deer impacts.,"Research on urban deer management has used bivariate analysis of public support for options. Multiple regression analyses tested predictors of support for deer reduction options (hunting; contraception; removal; no action or “letting nature take its course”) and willingness to change one’s own behavior (self-protection; yard re-planting; planting native plants). Deer reduction support correlated with wanting fewer deer and opinions about hunting’s and no-action’s effects; behavior-change support correlated with distrust of government, general environmental attitudes, and beliefs about deer impacts. Variations occurred for specific options (e.g., belief in no action increased with beliefs that nature lacked negative effects and reduced deer numbers; seeing global extinction as a problem and political liberalism favored native-species planting). Controlling for other variables, women supported hunting more and no action less than men, reversing prior bivariate findings.

However, consumers' high concerns about the environment are not always reflected in their purchasing behavior. This indicates the need for an in-depth understanding of the development of green consumption within the individual's belief system. In consideration of psychological approaches, a large body of research has examined the factors underlying ecologically conscious green consumer behavior and the interrelationships of these factors. However, most previous studies have concentrated on Western countries. Using a sample of Korean consumers, this study attempts to understand the basis of Korean green consumerism and find universal values that are cross -culturally important in guiding consumers' environmental attitudes and behaviors. To this end, this study relates Schwartz's 10 universal values (Schwartz 1992) to environmental behaviors in a hierarchical model of value -attitude -behavior. With reference to the value -attitude -behavior framework, the conceptual model developed for the study explains what motivations can be manifested in Korean consumers' environmental attitudes, and subsequently how the attitudes affect their green choices. Using the pattern of relationships among values that can be related to environmentalism, the first hypothesis holds that there would be particular relationships between motivational value types and environmental attitudes. Hypothesis 2 assumes that environmental attitudes predict environmental behaviors. On the basis of the claim that favorable attitudes toward the environment may be expressed in many different behaviors, the assumption is that consumers' favorable attitudes toward the environment would be linked to a variety of environmental behaviors because people with high environmental attitudes can be more interested in and knowledgeable about environmental actions.

Design/methodology/approach: A hierarchical model of personality is employed to investigate the nomological net of CVPA. The hierarchical model incorporates both trait antecedents (e.g. the traits of need for material resources, the need for uniqueness, and openness to experience) as well as value antecedents (the values of science importance, liberalism, and conservatism). In addition, the model includes three expected consequences of CVPA not previously investigated in the literature. Data were collected from a survey of 542 adult consumers who were broadly representative of the population of the USA. Findings: The findings identified six significant antecedents of CVPA: need for uniqueness, conservative values, liberal values, science values, openness to experience, and material needs. In addition, CVPA was positively related to individuals’ interest in representational art, abstract art, and environmental concern. Originality/value: The paper advances theory by proposing how traits and values work together to influence behavior. It advances understanding of CVPA by showing that a concern for visual aesthetics influences attitudes that extend beyond product aesthetics to a concern for the environment. Finally, methodological issues in identifying a construct’s nomological net, as well as the study’s managerial contributions, are discussed.

Design/methodology/approach: A hierarchical model of personality is employed to investigate the nomological net of CVPA. The hierarchical model incorporates both trait antecedents (e.g. the traits of need for material resources, the need for uniqueness, and openness to experience) as well as value antecedents (the values of science importance, liberalism, and conservatism). In addition, the model includes three expected consequences of CVPA not previously investigated in the literature. Data were collected from a survey of 542 adult consumers who were broadly representative of the population of the USA. Findings: The findings identified six significant antecedents of CVPA: need for uniqueness, conservative values, liberal values, science values, openness to experience, and material needs. In addition, CVPA was positively related to individuals’ interest in representational art, abstract art, and environmental concern. Originality/value: The paper advances theory by proposing how traits and values work together to influence behavior. It advances understanding of CVPA by showing that a concern for visual aesthetics influences attitudes that extend beyond product aesthetics to a concern for the environment.

Additionally, this study hopes to uncover whether and how the aforementioned psychographic variables help predict second-hand clothing shopping behaviour, specifically shopping frequency at second-hand clothing stores. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a survey method from 152 college students. Findings: Results showed that college students who shopped at second-hand clothing stores were more likely to be environmentally conscious, more sensitive to higher prices and more likely to wear used clothing to express a vintage look and to be 'green', and to perceive used clothing to be less contaminated, as compared to those who did not shop at second-hand clothing stores. This study concluded that, among college students, second-hand clothing shoppers may do so not only for economic reasons but also for creation of style and feeling special about themselves. Research limitations/implications: This study suggests that college students who shop at second-hand clothing stores are different from those who do not shop at second-hand stores in terms of their environmental attitudes, perceptions of contamination from used clothing, sensitivity to prices and how they feel about vintage clothing. Further, financial concern (i.e. price sensitivity) is no longer the only reason for second-hand clothing shopping. Originality/value: Little research has been conducted to understand second-hand clothing shopping behaviour among college students. This study examined multiple psychographic variables and provided insights into college students’ second-hand shopping behaviour.

Integrating three theoretical considerations (object of worry, scope of justice, and underlying values) it suggests that these two worldviews have implicit assumptions that associate them in subtler ways with some specific conceptions of justice. The environmentalist worldview was found to be associated with egalitarianism, which may be explained by environmentalism's concern with societal and global problems, its broad inclusionary scope of justice, and the self-transcendent values it advocates. In contrast, right-wing extremism was found to be associated with anti-egalitarianism, which can be attributed to its concern with the welfare of the in-group, its relative narrow exclusionary scope of justice, and its self-interest values of competition and individualism. After controlling for the possible effects of gender and socioeconomic status, these claims were mostly supported by hierarchical regression empirical analyses. Moreover, findings showed that endorsement of the environmentalist stance is more common than endorsement of the right-wing extremist stance.

Yet, research suggests that peopleâ€™s general environmental considerations, namely biospheric values and environmental self-identity, can drive peopleâ€™ pro-environmental behavior and may be important targets for interventions.

1115,"BalundÄ—, Audra;Perlaviciute, Goda;Steg, Linda",The relationship between peopleâ€™s environmental considerations and pro-environmental behavior in Lithuania.,"Given the need for global action on climate change, it is crucial to comprehend which factors motivate people in different countries to act more pro-environmentally. Lithuania is a post-socialist country that has recently increased commitment to foster pro-environmental behavior of individuals, by implementing interventions that target mainly the personal costs and benefits of relevant behaviors. Yet, research suggests that peopleâ€™s general environmental considerations, namely biospheric values and environmental self-identity, can drive peopleâ€™ pro-environmental behavior and may be important targets for interventions. These studies, however, have been mostly conducted in Western Europe and the United States, with limited evidence of relationship between peopleâ€™s biospheric values, environmental self-identity and pro-environmental behaviors across different countries and cultures. We performed a correlational study with a convenience sample in Lithuania (n = 334). Consistent with previous studies and the theory, our study revealed that peopleâ€™s general environmental considerations were positively related with recycling and environmental activism, but not with fuel-efficient driving and the use of sustainable transportation in Lithuania. We conclude that general environmental considerations are related to pro-environmental behaviors beyond Western Europe and the United States. Yet, future studies need to examine the boundary conditions of this relationship and test whether interventions targeting environmental consideration can be effective to promote pro-environmental behavior.

Regarding political ideologies, research concludes that liberals tend to be more concerned about the environment than conservatives. However, this two-dimensional take on political ideologies does not grasp the diversity of political views, which could be achieved by focusing on political values. In this research, we studied the role of personal and political values in predicting environmental attitudes and behavior in Kazakhstan, a developing country in Central Asia. Using an online survey (n = 305), we found that Security was a strong predictor of both environmental concern and New Environmental Paradigm (NEP), overshadowing the effect of traditionally accepted value dimensions of Self-Transcendence and Self-Enhancement. While Self-Direction positively predicted environmental concern, Universalism and Benevolence were positive predictors of NEP. Among political values, Civil Liberties predicted NEP positively, and had no significant effect on environmental concern, while Free Enterprise predicted environmental concern negatively, and had no significant effect on NEP. Environmental concern was a strong predictor of all pro-environmental behaviors included in the study (littering, recycling, environmental citizenship, and community action), fully mediating the effect of NEP.
